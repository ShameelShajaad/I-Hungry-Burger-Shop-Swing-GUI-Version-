## 🧾 Description
**A Java Swing-based burger shop ordering system** developed for ICET Institute’s Object Oriented Programming module.  

This version is **hard-coded** (all classes and resources are in the same folder) and demonstrates:  

- **Encapsulation**: All classes use private attributes with getters and setters  
- **Swing GUI**: Attractive interface with tables, buttons, and forms for easy order management  
- **Full functionality**: Place orders, update status, search customers/orders, and view orders & reports  

> ⚠️ Note: This project was implemented manually without GUI builders like NetBeans. Everything is hand-coded.

## 📦 Setup & Run Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShameelShajaad/I-Hungry-Burger-Shop-Swing-GUI-Version-.git
   ```
   - Do not move or rename any files after Cloning.  
   - The folder contains:  
     - Java source files (.java)  
     - Image files used by the program  
   - **Important:** Keep the image files in the same folder as the `.java` files. The program uses relative paths to load them.  

3. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.  
   - Example (Windows):  
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\iHungryBurgerShop
     ```

4. **Compile the Java Files**  
   - Compile all `.java` files before running the program:  
     ```bash
     javac *.java
     ```

5. **Run the Main Program**  
   - The main file is `iHungryBurgerShop.java`.  
   - Run the program with:  
     ```bash
     java iHungryBurgerShop
     ```

6. **Image Files**  
   - Do not change the location or filenames of images.  
   - They should remain in the same folder as the `.java` files.  
   - The program loads them using relative paths like `"burger.png"` or `"logo.jpg"`.
